I'm differentiating new videos into two categories, basically shorter and longer. I'll call them Bits and Pieces for the sake of branding (drink).

Shorter videos will be around two minutes and operate under a low-budget challenge. We'll shoot on an iPhone 6, use just practical lights and cheap audio gear like the Zoom H1 and Giant Squid lav mics. I want to work under these limits for a few reasons:

* Easier scheduling: We can shoot something most any day of the week because of the shorter scripts and reduced setup time.
* Produce more videos at a quicker pace.
* Focus on content and get shots not limited by intricate lighting setups.
* Shooting on iPhone means the camera operator doesn't need intricate photography knowledge, just an interest and an open schedule.
* Grab extra footage at any time and that will look consistent.
* The needed production equipment can fit into two small bags.
* Save money.

Longer videos will use a light film crew, with the great [Ben LeMenager](http://blulightmedia.com/) as Director of Photography. We'll use a Blackmagic Cinema Camera, professional lights, preamps, shotgun mics and much more of the shebang. Reasons for this:

* Get good footage that looks and sounds great.
* Experiment with longer content.
* Bore teenagers on YouTube.
